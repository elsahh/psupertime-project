## Description
To recreate the figures from the manuscript, run the models.py, pca.py and relevant_genes.py scripts.
The raw data was too large to upload into this repository, so the ipython-notebook "data_preprocessing.ipynb" does not work, unless you have the raw data.
Our preprocessed datasets can be found in the datasets directory. Our preprocessing pipeline is explained in detail in the manuscript.

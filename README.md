# psupertime-project
Project for completion of the module "Systems Biology: Computational Analysis and Interpretation of High-throughput Data"

## TODO
- Preprocessing:
  + log transform
  + row normalization
  + 400 most variable genes
  
- linear model
  + sklearn linear_model.LinearRegression()
  + normal and L1regularized
  + calculate kendall's tau
  
- ordinal logistic regression
  
- make figure

- write paper

## Ideas
- Differences between categorical and continuous timelabels.
  + pros & cons
- Logistic vs Linear: Linear model forces linearity on data, logistic is more flexible??
- discuss unique solutions
- Our code, specifically how we do ordinal logistic regression
- complain about R package installation

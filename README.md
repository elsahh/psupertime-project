## Description
To recreate the figures from the manuscript, run the models.py, pca.py and relevant_genes.py scripts.
The raw data is not a part of this repository, so the ipython-notebooks raw_data.ipynb and data.ipynb do not work, unless you have the raw data.
Our preprocessed datasets can be found in the datasets directory. Our preprocessing pipeline is explained in detail in the manuscript.
